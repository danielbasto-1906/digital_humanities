## Introduction (Thesis Topic)

Over the years, the European continent has taken the helm of globalisation, and it was the Portuguese who started this process in the 15th century. With the maritime discoveries of that era, initiated by Portugal and later followed by other European powers, Europe opened its doors to the world and established cultural encounters with other peoples who had previously been unreachable. The golden age of Portuguese discoveries has therefore become an essential topic for understanding the transformations of the world with manifestations of European identity, culture, and values, spread across the seas crossed by Portuguese caravels. In a journey to the present day, the European legacy remains very much alive in all corners of the globe, through language, religion and other European characteristics, clearly visible in America, Africa, Asia and Oceania.

Since the field of study of the thesis to be developed goes back to the 15th and 16th centuries, it is clear that a number of problems and challenges arise, for example, in relation to the level of access to historical sources. In addition, much of the heritage is no longer as well preserved as it once was, making in-depth study more demanding. This is why innovative digital technologies are speeding up the study and dissemination of the legacy left by Portuguese discoveries in the European and global context, thanks to increasingly widespread digital platforms.

Thus, the digital transformation of the new 21st century has, to a certain extent, reshaped Europe's relationship with its historical past. The digitisation of documents and archives in databases, for example, has completely redefined the framework between history, innovation and collective memory, with a new landscape of web archiving activities in Europe (Papaioannou, 2025, p. 19). With the integration of new digital tools in this area of academic study, researchers' work has become easier and more accessible, enabling them to subsequently disseminate their work on digital platforms, fostering dialogue and the sharing of scientific knowledge on the Internet.

## Digital Technologies in European Studies

Moving on to a broader field of study, European Studies also clearly benefit from technological innovations in the digital realm. As this is a multidisciplinary area, the tools facilitate the intersection between history, politics, law and culture, among others. Digital technologies are increasingly becoming a catalyst for deeper and more fruitful research, in addition to the components of teaching and international cooperation, which also benefit from these improvements. To justify this idea, we highlight several databases that bring together, on a single website, data relevant to the study and sharing of knowledge about Europe. Europeana, European Parliament Archives and EU Open Data Portal, for example, are three open-access platforms that bring together an important collection of historical and political documents and speeches that were previously only available to researchers through detailed searches in physical formats, such as books or scientific journals — now also available in digital format (Papaioannou, 2025, p. 19).

It is therefore possible to argue that the metamorphosis of the field of European Studies towards a more digital format not only promotes greater coverage of open access materials, but also makes data available to a wider range of researchers and historians. The task of conducting comparative research between the various processes of European integration is made easier and, in addition, European bodies and institutions promote greater trust, transparency and informed citizenship for all those who wish to access the data — not only academics, but also any citizen interested in the subject.

In recent years, there has been a growing use of new data visualisation tools, particularly for analysing the European Union's public and economic policies. In terms of security and citizen protection, the Geographic Information System (GIS) has also shown very favourable results in studies of borders, migration and, more generally, European geopolitics. The increased use of artificial intelligence tools also provides valuable assistance in areas such as text translation. Nevertheless, there are several ethical challenges that arise and that should remind us of the need for careful use of AI. Overall, digital technologies democratise access to information, which has never been as open and accessible as it is today, for all levels of society. They also create a space for greater international cooperation, which is more transparent, participatory and interconnected at the click of a button.

## Emerging Technologies

The advancement of digital technologies has been increasingly widespread, and the field of humanities, particularly European Studies, has only benefited from this. These new emerging and disruptive technologies have transformed academic and scientific practices and, although they bring benefits and advantages to those who use them, they also pose challenges that need to be addressed for the healthy use of the digital world and its tools.

The emergence of Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements in the field of technology and has facilitated the analysis of data on the European Union on various digital platforms. The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables more human-like interaction with data and textual analysis. On the other hand, there is the ethical bias of incorrect use if it overrides human action, which is always a priority.

Another emerging technology concerns the field of Data Analytics. Information, data and statistics from European institutions are stored in databases such as Eurostat or Eurobarometer, for example, and allow citizens to analyse a wide range of topics in a comparative manner. This makes research work more valid and based on concrete data that is easily accessible in the digital field, sometimes consisting of a three-level methodology combining web mapping, close reading of websites, and statistical analysis (Capurro, 2023, p. 1).

## Future of Technologies in the Humanities

As we have already seen, the future is expected to bring even greater cohesion between digital technologies and the field of humanities, particularly European Studies, whose data can be rich and complex, non-standardised in format, without common or consistent metadata (ALLEA, 2020, p. 6). The growing integration of digital tools in the humanities makes their study more agile and enables broader, faster and less laborious content and data analysis than in the past, which was tied to the physical format of documents.

However, the humanities must continue to uphold the value of critical thinking and reflection. It is essential that the future be balanced between the support fostered by the growth of digital technology and human interpretation and thought. The coming decades promise to bring even more radical change in the relationship between technology and the humanities, and with each passing day, knowledge becomes more accessible to all who seek it, fostering greater democratic and active participation by citizens.

## Conclusion

Technology has become a fundamental part of research in the humanities and also in European Studies. There has been a clear evolution from a now obsolete traditional methodology, based on physical and scattered content, to a present and future more grounded in the virtual world and its functionalities, such as Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics tools, among others. The way in which Europe and its legacy are studied and analysed has been redefined. These changes have resulted in greater accessibility of content and collaboration between the various stakeholders in the field, namely institutions and researchers. There is a richer analysis and sharing of historical and political information and content with digital tools.

Ethical considerations and potential risks must be addressed to ensure responsible use of digital technologies, while critical thinking and human reasoning remain irreplaceable by artificial intelligence.
